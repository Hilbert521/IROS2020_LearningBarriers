## Description

This folder contains code which implements the offline SVM-kernel method as well as the online SVM-kernel method for barrier function synthesis.
The following is a brief description of the files included in this folder:

* main.m : This file implements the online SVM-kernel approach and also has the ground truth trajectory generator built in

* main_offlineSVM.m : This file implements the offline SVM-kernel approach

* compare.m : This file plots trajectories generated by the approaches described above and also calculates the correlation coefficient (R), Frechet distance (F) and the Hausdorff distance (H) between the trajectories

* barrier_bwdist.m : This file implements the ground truth QP controller

* gradient_compute.m : This file computes the gradient of the barrier function

* nav_domain: This file implements the QP controller for the SVM-kernel based methods

* plot_ellipse.m : This file plots ellipsoids and circles for visualization purposes
